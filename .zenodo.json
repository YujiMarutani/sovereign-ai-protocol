  "description": "DAISS (Strategic Intelligence Operating System) provides a structural framework for analyzing how modern psychological models emerged from military imperatives rather than therapeutic ideals. This conceptual technical note outlines the lineage of military psychology and its migration into civilian institutions, identifying three enduring architectures: Controllable Organisms, Information Processors, and Maintainable Systems. This document is not the book itself, but a foundational conceptual node within a broader research and publication framework.",
