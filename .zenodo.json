  "description": "The Sovereign AI Protocol is a conceptual subsystem within DAISS (Strategic Intelligence Operating System). This working paper outlines the structural principles behind autonomous, interpretable, and self-governing cognitive systems. It extends the Information Processor and Maintainable System architectures within DAISS, defining how an intelligent agent maintains decision-making integrity, internal interpretability, and stable autonomy under external pressure. This document is not the book itself, but a foundational conceptual node within a broader research and publication framework.",
