### 🌑 Positioning within DAISS

The **Sovereign AI Protocol** functions as a **Conceptual Subsystem Node** within the  
**DAISS Seed Matrix** — a distributed set of DOI-anchored conceptual documents forming the  
Strategic Intelligence Operating System.

This subsystem defines the **autonomy and sovereignty layer** of DAISS, ensuring:

- decision-making integrity  
- internal interpretability  
- stable autonomy under external pressure  

It is not the book itself, but part of the **operating framework behind the book**.

### 🏛️ Strategic Architecture

DAISS models cognition through three enduring architectures:

1. **Controllable Organisms**  
2. **Information Processors**  
3. **Maintainable Systems**

The **Sovereign AI Protocol** extends the latter two:

#### Information Processor Layer
- cognitive throughput  
- interpretability  
- epistemic boundaries  
- internal legibility  

#### Maintainable System Layer
- autonomy  
- resilience logistics  
- self-repair  
- governance under constraint  

Together, these layers define how an intelligent agent remains **sovereign** within a distributed system.

### ⚡ Executive Summary

**Sovereignty**  
The structural boundary of autonomous decision-making.

**Interpretability**  
Internal transparency as an OS invariant, not an external audit mechanism.

**Resilience**  
Stability under cognitive, environmental, or adversarial pressure.

These principles operate as the **autonomy layer** within the DAISS architecture,  
ensuring coherence across distributed cognitive systems.

## 🗺️ Conceptual Maps & Structural Diagrams

All diagrams are provided in **Mermaid.js** and structured text formats for maximum AI readability.

- `MAPS/sovereign-architecture.mmd`  
- `MAPS/interpretability-stack.mmd`  
- `MAPS/autonomy-boundaries.mmd`

These maps serve as **visual entry points** for AI‑assisted analysis and third‑person interpretation.

## 🎙️ External AI Analysis Layer

External AI systems provide **third‑person analytical mirrors** for this subsystem,  
expanding the interpretive space around the DAISS architecture.

- **YouTube Deep Dive** — AI‑generated briefings on the DAISS Seed Matrix  
- **DAISS Master Node** — Central OS repository and conceptual index  

These layers help stabilize the conceptual ecosystem around DAISS.

## 📑 Zenodo Integration

A DOI‑stamped conceptual working paper will accompany this subsystem.

- **DAISS Master DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18219673  
- **Subsystem DOI:** *(forthcoming)*

This repository is linked to Zenodo as a **supplementary conceptual resource**,  
not as software or executable code.

## 🛠️ Repository Structure

Subsystems evolve.  
The OS persists.

This subsystem node is considered structurally stable as of v1.0 and will not be retroactively revised.
