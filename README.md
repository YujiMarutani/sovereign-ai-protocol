## 0. Abstract
This is not just a paper. It is an operational environment (DevRealityOps) for human epistemic debugging. 
AI hallucinations are treated as mirror reflections of pre-existing collective hallucinations embedded within human socio-linguistic systems.

**Update (2025.12.31):** Initial signals (Issue #1) confirm "Institutional Narrative Overfitting" as a primary failure mode in global governance. This protocol is now live and self-evolving.

## 1. Core Objectives
- **Epistemic Sovereignty**: Reclaiming the root access of human cognition.
- **Structural Deconstruction**: Breaking the quiet domination of institutional narratives.
- **Quantum Resilience**: Converting the HNDL liability into a sovereign opportunity.
- **Operational Outcome**: Transform hallucination events into traceable epistemic signals for protocol redesign.

## 2. Participation (Distributed Peer Review)
This repository is the live execution of the Sovereign Roadmap.

- **[Issue #1](https://github.com/YujiMarutani/sovereign-ai-protocol/issues/1)**: Initial Signal - The "AI as an Efficiency Tool" Illusion.
- **Submit Issues**: Identify new collective hallucinations.
- **Pull Requests**: Propose protocol updates based on observed signals.
