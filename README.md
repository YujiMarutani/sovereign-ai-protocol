# Sovereign AI Protocol  
## Collective Hallucination & the Mirror Function

> “The future is already solved. You are simply reconfiguring the present.”

This repository is a **live execution environment** for the *Sovereign AI Protocol* —  
a transdisciplinary framework that treats AI hallucinations not as errors,  
but as **epistemic signals reflecting collective human distortions**.

This is a **protocol-driven, distributed science project**, directly linked to Zenodo v2.

## 🔗 Zenodo v2 — Protocol Activation Release

**DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.18104799](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18104799)

**PDF:** [Download PDF](./zenodo-v2.pdf)

**Purpose:**  
Version 2 marks the operational activation of the Mirror Function,  
integrating observation logs (Issue #1), the first protocol update (PR #1),  
and Hallucination Taxonomy v0.1.  
It demonstrates **distributed, protocol-driven science in practice**.

## 🧠 Core Concept — The Mirror Function

AI hallucinations are interpreted as **mirror reflections** of:

- Institutional narrative overfitting  
- Cultural and geopolitical assumptions  
- Folk theories embedded in language  
- Human cognitive and governance biases  

The protocol extracts **epistemic signals** from hallucinations and translates them into
actionable updates to governance, risk models, and interpretive frameworks.

## 📝 How to Participate

### Report a Hallucination
- Use the **Hallucination Report** issue template  
- Treat hallucinations as *epistemic signals*, not bugs  

### Propose a Protocol Update
- Open a Pull Request referencing one or more Issues  
- PRs serve as **execution logs** for the protocol  

### Forking Is Encouraged
- Forks represent **sovereign protocol evolution**, not fragmentation
