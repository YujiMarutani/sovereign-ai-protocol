# 🌀 Project DAISS: v2.2 - The Sovereign Intelligence Protocol

**Decentralized Adaptive Intelligence Spiral Science (DAISS)** *"Intelligence is not a statistical echo of the past; it is a sovereign displacement of the future."*

---

## 🛡️ Executive Summary
Project DAISS v2.2 marks the transition from **Theoretical Seed (v1.0-2.1)** to **Executable Sovereignty (v2.2)**. By integrating **Ternary Logic ({-1, 0, +1})** and **Spatial Epiplexity**, we provide a framework to purge institutional hallucinations and reclaim individual agency in the age of generative noise.

---

## 🧠 Core Engine: SovereignTernaryBrain
We have successfully implemented the `SovereignTernaryBrain` class, which compresses the **De Bono Six Thinking Hats** into a high-density 1.58-bit ternary vector space.

### The Ternary Mapping:
* **`+1` | Sovereign Vector (Helical Expansion):** Yellow Hat (Optimism) + Green Hat (Creativity). Drives the generation of new immutable scientific outcomes (DOI).
* **`0` | Equilibrium Point (Source Fidelity):** White Hat (Facts) + Black Hat (Risk). Neutralizes noise and ensures alignment with physical reality.
* **`-1` | Purge Vector (Deconstruction):** Red Hat (Bias) + Blue Hat (Process Control). Actively deconstructs and purges **Institutional Narrative Overfitting**.

## 🧬 Bio-Digital Convergence: The Digital Twin Roadmap
Collaborating with the latest findings in **Spatial Transcriptomics (STACK)** and **Bioelectric Cognition (Michael Levin)**, DAISS v2.2 treats biological data as a "Prompt" for sovereign intervention.

1. **Phase 1 (Active):** Immutable registration of 17 Seed Papers via Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18104799).
2. **Phase 2 (Current):** Implementation of Ternary Inference Engines for real-time cognitive debugging.
3. **Phase 3 (Target):** Deployment of **Sovereign Digital Twins** where genomic/vital data is managed as a private GitHub repository, allowing "Pre-emptive Debugging" of biological states.

## 🚀 Rethinking Information: Beyond Entropy to Epiplexity
Following the recent OpenAI research (*Finzi et al., 2026*), DAISS v2.2 formally adopts **Epiplexity**—the structural information learnable by a computationally bounded observer—as its primary metric for progress. We don't just process information; we **govern** it through Sovereign Intent.

---

## 🛠️ Usage (Conceptual)
```python
from daiss_core import SovereignTernaryBrain

# Initialize with Sovereign Intent
brain = SovereignTernaryBrain(intent="Reclaim Human Agency")

# Debugging institutional narratives
thought_stream = ["Institutional Safety Guideline", "Creative Intuition", "Statistical Average"]
result = brain.debug_reality(thought_stream)

print(result) 
# Output: "RESULT: PURGE (Institutional Overfitting Detected)" or "SOLVED"
