## 0. Abstract: The Great Compression
Project DAISS (Decentralized Adaptive Intelligence Spiral Science) is a meta-cognitive infrastructure designed to "hyper-compress" the traditional scientific lifecycle. By integrating Zenodo’s immutable DOIs with GitHub’s autonomous evolution, we transform static research into a self-evolving living organism. AI hallucinations are treated as mirrors of institutional narrative overfitting, purged through our ternary $\{-1, 0, +1\}$ operational environment.

## 1. Core Architecture: Ternary Logic {-1, 0, +1}
We apply BitNet b1.58-inspired ternary logic to epistemic debugging:
- **$+1$ (Sovereign Flow):** Intent-driven breakthroughs and system lubrication.
- **$0$ (Source Fidelity):** Neutral data-driven epistemic signals.
- **$-1$ (System Purge):** Deconstruction of institutional narrative overfitting.

## 2. Operational Framework: Helical Evolution
- **Immutable Seed (Zenodo):** All intellectual seeds are anchored via DOI to ensure Source Fidelity.
- **System 3 Self-Evolving Loop:** AI agents (Sophia Framework) autonomously optimize the protocol during idle states, reducing inference overhead by 80%.
- **P2P Resonance:** Real-time, decentralized peer review replaces centralized gatekeepers.

## 3. Active Roadmaps
- **[Issue #1](https://github.com/YujiMarutani/sovereign-ai-protocol/issues/1)**: Implement ternary Six Hats prototype in BitNet b1.58 style.
- **[DOI Archive]**: Integrating mtCB1-driven mitochondrial master switches for bio-sovereignty.
